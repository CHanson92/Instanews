# Project: Instanews

## What is this project?

> I was required to create a social media style news format using the New York Times API. The original specifications of the project was to use HTML/CSS/jQuery to create the website, however with experience and keeping up with new technologies, I have updated the website to use Next.js that allows me to use static generation to provide a better user experience.

## How to run?

> <code>yarn dev</code>
