This is my Project 02 for RED Academy.

In this project I had to create a social media style news format, using the New York Times API. I had to use HTML, CSS, SASS, Gulp, JQuery & JavaScript to create the website.

I would like to thank the instructors and my classmates at RED Academy for their support during the project.
