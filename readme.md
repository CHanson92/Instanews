# Project: Instanews

----
## What is this project?

> In this project I had to create a social media style news format using the New York Times API. Originally I used HTML, CSS, SASS, Gulp, jQuery & JavaScript to create the website, however now I have updated it so it works as a React app.

## How to run?

<code>npm run start</code>
