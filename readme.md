# Project: Instanews

## What is this project?

> I was required to create a social media style news format using the New York Times API for a project that was marked at RED Academy in October 2018. The original specifications of the project was to use use HTML/CSS with jQuery to call the API & SCSS for styling that was complied with Gulp.

> November 2019 - I decided to revisit this project having gained commercial experience. I rewrote the app, replacing jQuery with React functional components (with Hooks) that complied with Webpack. I added deployment to GitHub Pages.

> April 2021 - I revisited the app and rewrote it using Next.js where I changed the API from the NYTimes API to News API & used server side rendering. The app now uses Incremental Static Regeneration to fetch new data every 10 seconds. I also changed from using SCSS to Tailwindcss.
